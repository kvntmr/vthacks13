Risk Assessment Process:

1. IDENTIFY RISKS
   - Review property characteristics
   - Analyze market conditions
   - Consider economic factors
   - Evaluate regulatory environment
   - Assess environmental factors

2. QUANTIFY RISKS
   - Assign probability of occurrence
   - Estimate potential impact
   - Calculate risk-adjusted returns
   - Consider correlation between risks
   - Develop risk scenarios

3. EVALUATE MITIGATION
   - Identify available risk controls
   - Assess cost of mitigation
   - Evaluate effectiveness
   - Consider residual risk
   - Plan for risk monitoring

4. MAKE DECISION
   - Compare risk-adjusted returns
   - Consider risk tolerance
   - Evaluate portfolio impact
   - Assess exit strategies
   - Document decision rationale

Risk Monitoring and Management:

ONGOING MONITORING:
- Market condition updates
- Tenant financial health
- Property performance metrics
- Regulatory changes
- Environmental factors
- Economic indicators

RISK RESPONSE STRATEGIES:
- Accept: For low-impact, low-probability risks
- Avoid: For high-impact, high-probability risks
- Mitigate: For manageable risks with available controls
- Transfer: Through insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms

PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT:
- Diversification across markets
- Diversification across property types
- Diversification across tenant types
- Maintain adequate reserves
- Regular portfolio review
- Stress testing scenarios

Risk Rating System:

LOW RISK (1-2):
- Stable markets with strong fundamentals
- High-quality tenants with strong credit
- Well-maintained properties
- Favorable regulatory environment
- Low environmental risk

MEDIUM RISK (3-4):
- Moderate market volatility
- Mixed tenant quality
- Average property condition
- Some regulatory uncertainty
- Moderate environmental risk

HIGH RISK (5-6):
- Volatile markets with weak fundamentals
- Poor tenant quality or high vacancy
- Significant maintenance needs
- Unfavorable regulatory environment
- High environmental risk

Risk-Adjusted Return Calculation:
Expected Return = Base Return - (Risk Premium Ã— Risk Rating)

Where:
- Base Return = Expected return without risk adjustment
- Risk Premium = Additional return required for risk
- Risk Rating = Overall risk score (1-6)
